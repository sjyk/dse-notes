# Notes on Block Chain and Crypto Currencies
In the last several years, we've seen a rise in "crypto-currencies", or digital data that works as a medium of exchange. These notes help demystify the underlying technologies behind this trend and the essential parts that we (as savy observers of this trend) should understand.

Imagine that you are a farmer living 8000 years ago (before the invention of money), and you need some new seeds for your farm. Your neighbor has exactly the seeds that you want, and you have an extra cow that you would be willing to trade for these seeds.
