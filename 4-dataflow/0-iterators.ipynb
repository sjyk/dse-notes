    "The mathematical notion of infinity is complex, and oddly enough, there are *degrees* of infinity. We are interested in objects that are infinitely big. Consider the following mathematical sets:\n",
    "* The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ \n",
    "* The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ \n",
    "* The set of numbers divisible by 3 and 17 $\\{51, 72, 153,...\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "What do all of these sets have in common? First, all of these sets are infinitely big. Next, they are all ordered, i.e., for any two elements $e_1$ and $e_2$ there is a precise $>,<,=$ relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we intuitively feel that $\\mathbb{R}$ is bigger than the other two sets. One aspect that is different between $\\mathbb{R}$ and the other two sets is a clear definition of the \"next\" element. For example, if we take a real number $1.01$ what is the next real number? Is it $1.010001$ or $1.01000001$? We can go smaller *ad infinitum* making this process a fool's errand. \n",

    "In this sense, every countable set is indexed by the natural numbers. There is a unique correspondence between a position (described by a natural number) and an element. In summary, countability requires two conditions, a unique first element and for each element a unique next element. By induction, this creates a sequence like the ones above. \n",

The design of iterators in programming languages mirrors the mathematical definitions of countability described above. \n",
